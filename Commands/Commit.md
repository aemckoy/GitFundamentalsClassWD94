# git commit

The command `git commit` will take all tracked changes (items added with [git add](./Add.md)) and package them up in hwat is called a commit.

Commits come with commit messages that are required for each commit.  You add a message to a commit comman by using `-m` flag followed by a message in quotes.

A commit message _can_ be anything, but best practice dictates that you should use the message to indicate th changes included in the commit. 

```
git add .
git commit -m "ex Added register functionality"
```
